ytfs: a filesystem for playing audio from youtube videos on plan9.

Ytfs requires access to a unix system with sshd, mpv, and youtube_dl to
convert the video to mp3.

Usage:
% ytfs myUnixHost
% touch /n/ytfs/VideoID
% play /n/ytfs/VideoID

The VideoID files are represented as mp3 files, and can be streamed or copied to disk.
